The print of the latest "SIAG on Optimization Views and News" has just landed in our mailbox. Haven't read our "Brief Introduction to Robust Bilevel Optimization" (jointly with Ivana Ljubic and Martin Schmidt) yet and didn't get a copy? You can also find it [here](https://siagoptimization.github.io/assets/views/ViewsAndNews-30-2.pdf).
