I had the pleasure to talk about decision uncertainty in bilevel optimization within the ERGO seminar series of the research group on optimization at the University of Edinburgh, UK. If you are interested in uncertainty modeling in the context of bilevel optimization, you should have a look at our survey "Bilevel Optimization Under Uncertainty" (jointly with Ivana Ljubic and Martin Schmidt). You can find it [here](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0377221723000073?via%3Dihub).
