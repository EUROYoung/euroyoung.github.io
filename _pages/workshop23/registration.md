## Registration

Registration is open from February, 13 to April, 09.
It consists of the following steps:

1. Fill in and submit the [registration form](https://forms.gle/5gRLxeoUbnvb7nW96).
2. Once we are able to confirm your participation, we will get in touch with you with a link to the EventBrite platform.
3. You can then pay the enrolment fee of 100€ on EventBrite.

Participation might not be confirmed in case we reach the maximum number of participants we can accommodate given our budget.

If a participant cancels their attendance, the organisation of the workshop keeps the entire registration fee of 100€ (in other words, the fee is a non-refundable deposit).
