The EUROYoung workshops are the main events organised by our Forum.
With these workshops we want:

* To __create a bond__ between researchers going through a delicate phase of their career and preparing themselves to be the faculty and practitioners of tomorrow;
* To promote __peer-education__ and give young researchers the opportunity to teach their colleagues something unique they have learnt;
* To share knowledge from established O.R. &ldquo;__seniors__&rdquo; to the new generations.
* To provide __affordable__ (approaching zero-cost) opportunities to young researchers to present their work, learn, and network.
* To promote [__EURO__](https://www.euro-online.org/), its activities, instruments, and resources.
