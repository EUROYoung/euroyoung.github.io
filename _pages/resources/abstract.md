__There is a limited number of places available__. If applications exceed this limit, selection will be made on a first-come, first-served basis, while also ensuring representation of researchers from different countries to foster international collaboration.

__Priority will be given to early-career researchers affiliated with institutions within EURO.__

The name of the file must be your own name (e.g., surnames_names.pdf).

## After acceptance
The EUROYoung workshop is focused on early career researchers, consequently we try our best in order to keep the fee as low as possible.
In return we ask to the participants to avoid bad practices such as submitting abstracts if not completely sure about attending.
Given that, in order to ensure your spot at the workshop __the selected participant must pay the fee within 10 days after the acceptance notification__. If not, the selection will be intermediately canceled, and the spot will be re-assigned to other candidate.
