<h1 id="abstracts">Abstracts</h1>
All participants wishing to attend the workshop are required to submit an abstract __following the provided template__. 

Each attendee is allowed to present one abstract at the conference.

Please submit your abstract __no later than April 15, 2025__. All submissions will be reviewed by members of the scientific committee. Notification of the decision of the referees will be sent to the corresponding author by April 25, 2025.


__There is a limited number of places available__. If applications exceed this limit, selection will be made on a first-come, first-served basis, while also ensuring representation of researchers from different countries to foster international collaboration.

__Priority will be given to early-career researchers affiliated with institutions within EURO.__


## Template
You can download the <a href="/assets/pdffiles/template.zip" download="EUROYoungtemplate">LaTeX template here</a>.
Please follow the instructions provided inside the file, i.e., __do not modify the format of the template__.
Your abstract must fit in a single page including the references and the short bio of the speaker.

## Submission Process
All the abstracts must be submitted in PDF format using the following [form (here).](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1g7nDFTNu0j_puacc3akc6wDTKjNOJqmhoyD243YC3KI/viewform?edit_requested=true)
The name of the file must be your own name (e.g., surnames_names.pdf).  

__Please notice that those submissions that do not meet all the instructions provided might be discarded.__ 

## After acceptance
The EUROYoung workshop is focused on early career researchers, consequently we try our best in order to keep the fee as low as possible.
In return we ask to the participants to avoid bad practices such as submitting abstracts if not completely sure about attending.
Given that, in order to ensure your spot at the workshop __the selected participant must pay the fee within 10 days after the acceptance notification__. If not, the selection will be intermediately canceled, and the spot will be re-assigned to other candidate.

## How to get to Naples

Arriving in Naples from other European countries is quite convenient, thanks to its well-connected transportation network. 
The best way to get there is clearly by air ✈️ to Naples International Airport (NAP).

Naples International Airport (Aeroporto di Napoli-Capodichino, NAP) is the main airport serving the city.
It has direct flights from major European cities, including London, Paris, Madrid, Berlin, Amsterdam, Zurich, Vienna, and Barcelona.
Budget airlines like Ryanair, easyJet, and Wizz Air offer affordable flights.
From the airport, you can reach the city center in 15-20 minutes via:
Alibus shuttle (€5) to Naples Central Station and the port.
Taxi (fixed fare of around €25).
Notice that __rideshare apps like Uber are not legal in Italy__!

## What does the fee include?

The fee will not exceed __€200 (worst-case scenario)__, and depending on the additional funding that we can get, the price might decrease.
The fee covers: 

__Accommodation in shared rooms (3 guests per room) for 3 nights__ (from Wednesday to Friday).

__Meals during the workshop__ (from Wednesday's dinner to Friday's dinner, including the respective breakfast, lunch and dinner during the mentioned period).


Participants who wish to stay in a __single-use double room or a double room with an accompanying person__ should contact the hotel directly. 
Please ensure to mention the EUROYoung Workshop October 2025 in your email and include us in CC so we can track participant accommodations.

Single-use double room: €80 per night
