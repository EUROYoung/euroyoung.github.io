## Call for abstracts

To maintain an atmosphere of conviviality, foster fruitful discussion and keep the quality of the event high, **all sessions at the workshop are plenary**.
For this reason, not all participants will have time to five a full-length talk (15 minutes + 5 minutes for questions).

This year we decided to use the following (experimental) approach for abstract evaluation.
All participants are invited to send their abstract in one of the following forms:
* One slide briefly describing the content of the talk (recommended), or
* One paragraph of text briefly describing the content of the talk.

These submissions must be sent via email to [workshop@euroyoung.eu](mailto:workshop@euroyoung.eu) between March, 15 and April, 15.

Starting from April, 16, we will share the submissions with all participants, who will be able to **cast a vote** for their favourite abstracts.
On April, 30, when the voting period closes, the 15 highest-voted abstracts will be selected for a **full-length talk**.
The remaining abstracts will be presented during our "**pitch sessions**": rapid-paced sessions in which each participant has 3 minutes available to pique the interest of the audience.

In this way, we hope to give everyone a chance to present their research project while maintaining all sessions plenary.
