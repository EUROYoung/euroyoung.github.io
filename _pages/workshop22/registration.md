## Registration

Registration is open from January, 21 to March, 14.
You can register by filling in and submitting [the registration form](https://forms.gle/QjZuPqK7LrzL3RnQ7) and completing the payment of the enrolment fee of 50€.
Within a few days of the registration, you will receive an email with detailed information on how to pay the fee.
Your registration will be valid after we receive the payment.

In case of cancellation of attendance:
* If a participant cancels their attendance, the organisation of the workshop keeps the entire registration fee of 50€ (in other words, the fee is a non-refundable deposit).
* In case the organisers have to postpone the workshop (for example, due to the current pandemic), participants who paid the registration fee will be automatically signed up for the new dates.
Alternatively, they can decide to have their fee refunded.
In this latter case, the university (which processes the payments) keeps an administrative fee of 10€.
