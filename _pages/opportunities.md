### Modelling Associate vacancy at the Kent Business School, University of Kent 

Do you enjoy developing simulation models? Do you want to get more experience in this?
Through this project you will have the opportunity to work on real world model development in (human and animal) health care. You will work closely with Professor Kathy Kotiadis, an expert in discrete event simulation modelling (theory and applied practice) to undertake simulation studies exploring the impact of new diagnostic developments on organisations and especially the NHS. Given the length of the appointment (until December 2028), you participate in a number of simulation studies for different diagnostic developments, in collaboration with external stakeholders e.g. diagnostic SMEs, clinicians/end users.  By the end of the project you will:

* have gained additional modelling and simulation skills 
* be part of a leading UK Operational Research department 
* have contributed to diagnostic developments from innovation to market (implementation)
* gained dissemination skills (e.g. conference and journal dissemination)
* be a leading expert in health systems simulation modelling.
