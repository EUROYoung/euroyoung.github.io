## Workshops/Summer Schools and other
### The First ROAR-NET Training School on Computational Modelling of Combinatorial Optimisation Problems
will take place at the Luxembourg Institute of Science and Technology (LIST) in Belvaux, Luxembourg, from
16 to 20 June 2025.
__Trainee application deadline: 4 April 2025__.
More details [HERE](https://roar-net.eu/events/first-training-school/).
ABOUT THE TRAINING SCHOOL:
The First ROAR-NET Training School will consist of a combination of
lectures, problem-solving group projects, poster presentations by the
Trainees, and team-building activities. Topics include:

        * Problem structuring
        * Problem modelling for constructive search and for local search
        * The ROAR-NET API specification
        * Practical aspects of model development and implementation

Each project involves the development, implementation (coding), and
evaluation of a model for a given optimisation problem and will be
carried out by a team composed of 4-5 Trainees and a mentor (a Trainer).

WHO CAN APPLY?

PhD students, postdocs, researchers, and innovators with good
programming and/or optimisation skills are invited to apply to attend
the school as Trainees. Financial support is available for eligible
applicants from COST Member and Near Neighbour Countries.

Trainee application deadline: 4 April 2025

## Ph.D. positions


## Postdoc positions

### Postdoc University of Kent
Applications are invited for a Postdoctoral Research Associate (PDRA) position in the area of Operational Research  (specifically Modelling and Simulation) ideally __starting in June 2025__. The PDRA will be part of the Centre for Advanced Diagnostics Development and Application (CADDA) based at the __University of Kent__ and also part of the Department of Analytics, Operations and Systems (DAOS) at the Kent Business School.
The PDRA will lead on simulation studies for the newly formed Centre for Advanced Diagnostics Development and Application (CADDA) part funded by Research England development fund â€“ UKRI. The vision of CADDA is to provide a means by which new innovative diagnostic tools are delivered to the health services.
The successful candidate will work closely with Prof Kathy Kotiadis to undertake simulation studies exploring the impact of new diagnostic developments on organisations and especially the National Health System.
Given the length of the appointment __(until December 2028)__, the postholder would be expected to undertake a number of simulation studies for different diagnostic developments, in collaboration with external stakeholders e.g. diagnostic SMEs, clinicians/end users.
